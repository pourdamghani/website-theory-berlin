I am a junior professor (â‰ˆ assistant professor) of distributed computing at Humboldt University of Berlin.

My research focuses on theoretical foundations of distributed computing. I also occasionally work in the area of theoretical ecology, mainly using stochastic models to study the dynamics of large-scale ecological communities.
