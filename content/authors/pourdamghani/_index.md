I am a Ph.D. candidate at the INET research group at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working under the supervision of Prof. Stefan Schmid. I am also an associated researcher with PLAMADISO research group at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society.

Previously I was a researcher at the University of Vienna and completed research internships in IST Austria under the supervision of Prof. Chatterjee. I got my B.Sc. from the Sharif University of Technology.

I am interested in algorithm design and analysis with applications in networks, distributed systems, and blockchains. My particular focus is on self-adjusting networks.
