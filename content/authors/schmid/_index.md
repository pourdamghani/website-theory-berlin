I am a Full Professor at the Technical University of Berlin, Germany, working part-time for the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT). I am also a Principle Investigator and Member of the Institute Council of the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society in Berlin. I obtained my diploma (MSc) in Computer Science at ETH Zurich in Switzerland (minor: micro/macro economics, internship: CERN) and did my PhD in the Distributed Computing Group led by Prof. Roger Wattenhofer, also at ETH Zurich (pokal). As a postdoc, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Christian Scheideler at the Chair for Efficient Algorithms at the Technical University of Munich and at the Chair for Theory of Distributed Systems at the University of Paderborn, in Germany. From 2009 to 2015, I was a senior research scientist at the Telekom Innovation Laboratories (T-Labs) and at TU Berlin in Germany (Internet Network Architectures group headed by Prof. Anja Feldmann). In 2013/14, I was an INP Visiting Professor at CNRS (LAAS), Toulouse, France, and in 2014, I was a Visiting Professor at Universit√© catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. From 2015 to 2018, I was a (tenured) Associate Professor at Aalborg University, Denmark, which also hosts the UNESCO chair in problem-based learning and where I received my university pedagogy diploma. From 2018 to 2021, I was a Full Professor at the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Vienna, Austria where I also served in the executive board of the Vienna Cybersecurity and Privacy Research Cluster (ViSP). In 2022, I received a fellowship for a Sabbathical at the Israel Institute for Advanced Studies (IIAS) in Jerusalem, Israel. Since 2021, I am a member of the Council and the Board of the European Association of Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Editor-in-Chief of the Bulletin of the EATCS. Since 2019 I serve as an Editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN). I received the IEEE Communications Society ITC Early Career Award 2016 and an ERC Consolidator Grant 2019, and co-founded the startup company Stacktile supported by Germany's EXIST program.
