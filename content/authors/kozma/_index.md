I am a researcher in computer science, interested in data structures, algorithms, combinatorics, and other related (and unrelated) topics. Since 2018 I work as an assistant professor at Freie Universitat Berlin, in the Theoretical Computer Science group (semi-official page).

I obtained my PhD at Saarland University in Saarbrucken, Germany, where my advisor was Raimund Seidel. Afterwards I spent a year as a postdoc at Tel Aviv University, hosted by Haim Kaplan and Yossi Azar, and a year at TU Eindhoven, hosted by Nikhil Bansal. A long time ago I worked and/or studied at Helsinki University of Technology (later renamed Aalto University), and TU Cluj in Romania, where I'm actually from.
